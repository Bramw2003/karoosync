## Overview

karoosync gets today's workout from [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) for usage on a Hammerhead Karoo bike computer.

## Getting Started
[Install](INSTALL.MD)


## Caveat
If you run the app multiple times for the same date, you will see duplicates in the Hammerhead dashboard that might have to be removed manually. Bandwidth permitting I'll try to improve that workflow in a future version.
